Don. Abel and Rene distribution was created not only to offer the most premium Mezcal from Oaxaca, Mexico but to promote, educate, and to carry on the traditions of our ancestors.  Mezcal is just more than a shot or a mix drink. There is rich tradition, culture, and meaning behind Mezcal from Oaxaca.   From family ceremonies, to dancing el jarabe, to traditional events like the Guelaguetza, and la Mayordomia: you will find Mezcal as being an important part of these experiences.  We are so proud to now offer premium artisan Mezcal here in the United States from Oaxaca, Mexico. Our company name is dedicated to our forefathers Abel Luis Vazquez and Rene Baldomero Hernandez who immigrated to the United States in search of better opportunities for their respective families. They both simulated to the way of life in the United States but they never forgot or let go of their culture-traditions. Don. Abel and Rene Distribution LLC is a homage to honor their legacy.
